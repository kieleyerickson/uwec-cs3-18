    <h4>My Favorite Things</h4>
        <p>I love the summer. When it's summer I get to just enojoy the weather and being outside. My favorite thingd are to read ( I love fantasy novels), tan, swim, bake, and see my friends and the perfect time to do all these things is the summer! My family is a huge boating family, so to me it seems like a no brainer that all my favorite activites would be based around it.</p>
